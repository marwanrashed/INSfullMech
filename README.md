# INSfullMech
This is a project for implementing a standard python package for INS Mechanization. 

## Version 1.0
The first version contatins Three modules: 
- Main.py: The test file.
- IntializationParameters.py: This module has the class InitINS, It consists of all the intialization methods needed before the mechanization. 
- Mechanization.py : This file is the main development modul that has the mechanization class, and the algorithm needed methods. 

## What's next ?
- There are two modules needed:
	- Debugging module: to test the mechanization errors in the same time of the iterations. 
	- Visualization module: to visualize the errors, parameters, and the trajectory.
	- Testing module: Performs unit tests over the main methods to avoid crashes or solution drifts.
